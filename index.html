            <h4>Reviews</h4>
            <p>
                <cite><a href="https://www.soundandsoulonline.com/2022/09/09/review-the-man-from-waco-charley-crockett/">Sound and Soul</a></cite> gives a track-by-track breakdown of the individual songs and sums up the overall effect of the album this way:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                The album is emotionally conceptual, loose of theme, but dedicated to filling in pieces of Charley's vagabond-to-headliner trajectory.... More than any single attribute or trait, Crockett values honesty. It's his currency, and he spends it generously on <i>The Man From Waco</i>.
            </blockquote>

                <cite><a href="https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/album-review-charley-crocketts-the-man-from-waco/">Saving Country Music</a></cite> praises the nostalgic feel of Crockett's newest release and explains how its approach differs slightly from recent albums while remaining of a piece with his style:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Like ferreting through your grandfather's old belongings, and unearthing a rare collection of 78s representing a sumptuous cross-section of bygone American music that despite the dated verbiage and vintage styles, feels vibrant and fresh as ever as it hits your ears that have been rendered voracious from the the vacuous audio offerings of the here and now, Charley Crockett has assembled a voluminous discography in a relatively short span that continues to mesmerize in its scope, breath, and quality, with his latest offering <i>The Man From Waco</i> fitting right in line with his run of impressive output.
